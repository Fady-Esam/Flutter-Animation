# Flutter Animation

A Flutter project demonstrating the use of built-in animation widgets as well as custom animations. Includes practical examples to help understand animation concepts and techniques in Flutter app development.

## ✨ Features
🔄 Implicit Animations:
Use built-in widgets like AnimatedContainer, AnimatedOpacity, AnimatedCrossFade, and TweenAnimationBuilder to animate property changes smoothly and easily without manual controllers.

🎮 Explicit Animations with AnimationController:
Fine-grained control over animations using AnimationController, Tween, CurvedAnimation, TweenSequence, AnimatedBuilder, and RotationTransition for advanced and custom animation logic.

🔁 Hero Animations:
Seamless transitions between screens using the Hero widget and matching tags, creating visually appealing shared element animations.

🧩 Transformations:
Apply dynamic 2D/3D transformations like rotate, scale, and translate using Transform, Matrix4, and user gestures via GestureDetector.

📋 Animated Lists:
Animate list item insertions and removals with AnimatedList, insertItem, removeItem, SlideTransition, and SizeTransition.

🖌️ Custom Paint Animations:
Create custom visuals using CustomPaint and CustomPainter, such as an animated bouncing ball synced with animation values.

🔂 Looping Animations with Status Listeners:
Implement repeated animations by listening to animation status (completed or dismissed) and triggering forward() or reverse() actions.
